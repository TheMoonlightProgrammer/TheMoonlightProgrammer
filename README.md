## Hi there, I'm Lindsey and this is a bit about me 👋🐺💜

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... College
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... General Computer Science for my major
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing right now, just focusing on school
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I'm a girl
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm a technically new college student. I had two years at a community college but this is my first time at a 4-year school, living away from home, being an actual adult.
